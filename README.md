# ~ Pads ~

A fast travel mod for minecraft, based on the game [TUNIC's](https://store.steampowered.com/app/553420/TUNIC/) fast travel system.

As such, there are **MILD** spoilers for some of TUNIC's primary mechanics & story elements. I'll avoid talking about how Pads pulls from TUNIC, but I would highly recommend anyone who enjoys this mod play the game, too!~

### ~ How it works ~
Pads uses a simple, affordable fast travel system. 

* ***To build a pad***, simply place down a 3x3 of gold blocks, and surround it with any combination of slabs and stairs. Should even work with modded blocks, in theory!

* ***To use a pad***, stand on the center gold block, and hold shift. After a few seconds, you'll be teleported to the Spirit World. Each spirit world is unique, per player. You can't die in the spirit world! If you fall off the world you just get teleported back up to the top of the world, and you can't take damage. I would recommend keeping pearls and/or elytra on hand though, you can get stuck in blocks sometimes because random generation, and you can't break or place any blocks in the spirit world.

* ***Pads use fuel!*** If you use a teleporter pad, one of the gold blocks has a 50% chance to turn to stone! You can either let this happen and just replace it with gold again (lame) or use crying obsidian as a fuel source (cool!). Every time you use a teleporter pad, it will search directly below the gold blocks for crying obsidian. If it finds some, it has a 5% chance of turning it to normal obsidian. If it doesn't find anything, it falls back to the gold.

* ***All pads that you've ever used will be placed in the spirit world***, connected to other pads by paths of spirit blocks. The spirit blocks around a pad in the spirit world match the fully solid blocks around it in the overworld, so you can get a rough idea of where each teleporter pad goes. They tend to move around a little when you discover new teleporter pads, because of the way they're stitched together, so keep that in mind, too!

* ***You CAN visit other player's spirit worlds...*** But I won't tell you how!~ Experiment, and find out :3

### ~ What it needs ~

* Pads is a ***Quilt Exclusive*** mod! Official ports to other platforms will not be made! <sub>Though I'm not against unofficial ports.</sub>
* Pads uses [QFAPI](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl). At time of writing, it's made for 5.0.0~
* Pads is made for Minecraft 1.19.3, but 1.19.4 should work too! Updates will (hopefully) come out as Minecraft & Quilt update!
* Pads needs people to use it! Mod can't work if there's nobody using it!
